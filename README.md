# EE102-Term_Project
Implemented a free flying game on BASYS 3 with VHDL, using VGA cable and digital sound censors

A Flapy Bird-like game where the user gives its input by sound. 

The player is the white box it horizontal position is constant but it vertical position changes.
The white box has an acceleration. There is a constant downwards acceleration which
represents the gravity and the player can create an upwards acceleration proportional to the
sound he is making. By controlling the box altitude the player tries to dodge the randomly
spawning obstacles which are coming from right of the screen to the left of the screen. The
longer the player plays more and faster obstacles start coming and the player tries to survive
as long as possible.
